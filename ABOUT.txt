This is a basic 3D rendering program to project points in 3D space to a 2D screen.
I have projected a cube and a cube with heart on its sides in orthographic view ;).
and also a cube in perspective view.

do your own projections with this code or anything u like.


Later..


I am also going to project a Tesseract (a 4D cube) in cmd without any graphics library just using ASCII chars in cmd window.
